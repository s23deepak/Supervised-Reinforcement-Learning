The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was formed, in 1927, with a brief \u2018to raise the cultural, educational, and scientific standards\u2019 of film. That noble purpose was sustained until July 12, 2013, the release date for the film \u2018Grown Ups 2,\u2019 in which a frightened deer urinates on Adam Sandler\u2019s face. In the animal\u2019s defense, one could argue that it was merely taking movie criticism to a higher and more clarifying level. A) The film 'Grown Ups 2' achieved the noble purpose of the Academy. B) The noble purpose of the Academy was no longer sustained after July 12, 2013. C) The film 'Grown Ups 2' did not achieve the noble purpose of the Academy. D) The Academy continued to sustain its noble purpose after July 12, 2013."
